All of the variable assignments should use the this pointer to be assigned. This will ensure that the assignments are for the current object.



In the HourlyEmployee Class, the initial wageRate and Hours should be set using their set method where the check for the value being greater than zero is already executed.

public HourlyEmployee(String theName, Date theDate,              // change this constructor to be something like this.
                       double theWageRate, double theHours)
    {
         super(theName, theDate);
             this.setRate(theWageRate); 
             this.serHours(theHours);
    }
