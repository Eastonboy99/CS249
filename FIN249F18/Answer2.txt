Object-Oriented languages allow for a much simpilier application. Since the Student, Faculty, and Book Store all use the same methods in this program, object oriented programming 
allows for these objects to be related under the Notifications class. With out this, these "objects" would most likely be structs or a weird set of variables that would make both
writing the code more challenging and the code being poorly optimized. I used an abstract class instead of using an interface here since all 3 of the Notification classes used the
same set method.
